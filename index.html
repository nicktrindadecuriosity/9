<h1> well done... kkkkk </h1>

<pre>
it´s your birthday, if i was there i promise, i would try to give u something special. But i am not.
So i made this little game with my coding skills... and... a prepared a song. This is what i can do kkkk YOU KNOW IT.
My brazilian way is screaming for hugs LOTS OF BIRTHDAY HUGS kkkkk SO this is a hug gif:

hm... i have so much to sayyyy but... AAAHHH 

okay. FOCUS.

this is a special day, and You are special too. sometimes, u can feel lonely, and just a grain in the sand
but u are special, u are a very special grain in the sand. And U have a great life foward, you are smart, even u think
you aren't kkkkk. I said once u r an inspiration to me, you ARE. These life problems, they shall pass, all these doubts
and chaos... the shall pass, they are not important compared to the great man you are 석민. 

Maybe i am almost crying? maybe
kkkkk but it's just because i like u so much, that i want to see u happy. DID U UNDERSTAND? H A P P Y. And those words i said before
they came from the bottom of my heart. i swear. they are the most pure truth. And if u r not feeling like this great man
i am talking about, it's okay, one day i hope when u look at the mirror u will see him.

maybe i am crying now? maybe (LET'S PRETEND THIS IS NOT HAPPEN I AM A BAD GIRL, AND BAD GIRLS DON'T CRY)

I think in life, doesn't matter what age we are, it's always time to learn and grow up, and this new year for u will be a big chance
to learn more, meet new people, know more about yourself. AND as your friend i wish all these things happen magically, softly and in the best way. 
I hope all your wishes come true (the good ones kkkk) and may God blesses you, 
giving you all the support and love you need. 

I COULD SPEND THE WHOLE DAY HERE TALKING GOOD THINGS TO YOU... BUT I DON'T WANT KKKK IT'S ENOUGH.
